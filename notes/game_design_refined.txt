COMBAT
Leaders:
    *) 'Leader Dynamics' (Special rules that the character brings into
        battle)
        - These may affect the ally or enemy team, or both.
        - They can have a huge variety of effects.
    *) A 10-unit 'deck' of units that they carry with them into dungeons
    *) In combat, they choose a 4-unit party from that deck
    *) On each turn, they have a max and current AP value (consumed by
       taking actions)
    *) An inventory of items
    *) They're going to be able to grow somehow.

Units:
    *) A max and current HP value
    *) A DEF value (which scales weaker attacks harder than stronger ones)
    *) An ATK value which scales the damage of their abilities
    *) A max and current MP value which is consumed by some abilities
    *) An LP value which is reduced when the unit is KO'd and by some
       special abilities
           - When a unit's LP reaches zero, they cannot be revived by
             normal means.
    *) An exhaustion percentage. After each encounter, a unit's exhaustion
       goes up, making them less effective. Rest in 'town' to restore
       exhaustion. The idea is to encourage leaders to use more of their
       10-unit 'deck' when choosing 4 units to bring into battle.
    *) A primary class, whose abilities they have unrestricted access to.
       For this reason, a unit's primary class is likely to determine the
       bulk of their function in battle.
    *) A secondary class, whose abilities the unit can access the first 2/3
       tiers of. Because they can't access the most powerful abilities of
       this class, this secondary class adds dynamism and utility to a unit
       outside of their primary role.
    *) A tertiary class, whose abilities the unit only has very limited
       access to (only the first tier). These abilities aren't going to be
       hugely useful most of the time, but they may come in clutch when the
       going gets rough.
    *) A permanently-bound 'equipment' slot, which affects the unit's growth
       and provides their tertiary class. May also add a 'dynamic'.
    *) A 'unit dynamic,' which is a special rule that this unit takes into
       battle.
    *) A list of active status effects, both positive and negative.
    *) An 'elemental' type that will only come into play under certain
       'dynamics'. Maybe some units have a dynamic (or status affect) which
       will make them vulnerable to attacks by units of a certain type. Or
       more robust against units of a certain type. Or maybe they get
       powered up (or weakened) when they're on a team with a unit of a
       certain type, or when the enemy team contains a unit of a certain
       type. Unlike Pokemon, we're not looking at rigid 'type' match-ups,
       RPS-style. Instead, unique dynamics and status affects will
       arbitrarily give units a variety of strengths or weaknesses based on
       type.

Combat Flow:
    *) Before battle, the ally leader and the opponent leader will roll for
       'initiative'. Whoever loses this roll will pick one unit from their
       deck to bring into battle, and this choice is visible to both
       parties.
    *) After each unit pick, the opposing leader will get their turn to pick
       a unit, which will also be visible to both parties. This will go on
       until both leaders have selected 4 units from their deck to bring
       into the encounter.
    *) The leader who rolled initiative will also get the first turn in
       battle.
    *) On a leader's turn, they'll have a limited amount of AP to consume by
       using their unit's actions and actions that the leader may take
       directly.
    *) Typical actions that a 'unit' would take will have the most direct
       impact on battle. They'll typically target either themselves or the
       enemy which is currently in the 'ring,' but they may also sometimes
       target other units on either team (targeting a non-ring unit on the
       enemy team should be pretty rare, since the game's mechanics should
       be balanced around the in-ring units being the vulnerable ones and
       the out-of-ring units being relatively safe).
    *) Typical actions that a 'leader' would take will have a less direct or
       more 'tactical' impact on the overall battle, commonly including
       things like 'tagging' different units into the ring or using an item
       from their inventory. Certain leaders may also have special abilities
       that they can use, and these would be tactically very powerful
       because they can be used regardless of which unit is in the ring. For
       this reason, they probably shouldn't be directly related to disabling
       the enemy team.
    *) Unlike in some JRPGs, all of the units would have all of their
       attributes restored between fights except for 'exhaustion' (and maybe
       LP).

Abilities:
    *) An affect, obviously. This might be to deal HP damage to the opponent
       currently in the ring. It could do MP damage. It could do LP damage.
       It could inflict a temporary status change, which could give a
       variety of buffs or nerfs to the target. It could heal HP. It could
       heal MP or even the leader's AP, in some rare cases.
    *) A cost. Virtually all abilities will cost the leader's AP, but
       abilities could have a wide variety of costs, including the unit's
       MP, or HP, or even LP. It could be a negative status ailment that the
       user or maybe even other units on the team would have to take on.
       There could be any number of interesting costs associated with using
       an ability. Some could be very simple and others could be very
       complex and have a long-term impact on the strategy for the rest of
       the encounter.
    *) A 'tier' that affects whether or not they can be used under a
       'secondary' or 'tertiary' class. Tier 3 abilities can only be used if
       the unit has the class in question as their 'primary' class.

Status Change (Ailment, Buff):
    *) These will apply a new rule to the unit similar to a dynamic. These
       affects may be positive, negative, or otherwise just affect or limit
       the tactics available to the player when they utilize that unit.
    *) It'll have a condition for the status change to end. This could be a
       variety of rules, including dealing a certain amount of damage or
       taking a certain amount of damage, or having a number of turns pass,
       or consuming some amount of MP or AP or getting swapped out -- any of
       things. This would be independent of the status change itself, and
       the condition for the status change's end could be lessened by some
       abilities, or made MORE severe by other abilities, or directly
       REMOVED or CURED by other abilities still. Maybe some abilities would
       randomly change the condition, so the player could hope they end up
       with something easier.
    *) An optional condition for the status change to BEGIN. This would
       limit or influence the strategic choices made by the leader depending
       on whether they want to trigger the status change sooner or, in the
       case of a negative status change, avoid triggering it.

Class:
    *) A collection of tiered abilities.
    *) The ability tiers available to the unit depend on whether this class
       is bound as a Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary class.
    *) Should have abilities cherry-picked so that they encourage the unit
       into a tactical role in combat. The classes that a unit has available
       to them will obviously impact what sorts of teams they work best in,
       what sorts of teams they work best against.
    *) No class should be too flexible with what sorts of tactics are
       available to it, not only to prevent a unit or team from being over-
       powered, tactically, but also because we want for a unit's
       flexibility to come from its COMBINATION of Primary, Secondary, and
       Tertiary.
    *) A class should have a relatively focused idea of what it's 'for' in
       battle.

Battlefield:
    *) Has a 'ring' which contains two units -- one from each team.
    *) Only units in the ring and the leaders can take action.
    *) Units in the ring can be swapped for an AP cost.
    *) Some abilities may affect single units outside of the ring, or entire
       teams, or maybe only the units that are outside of the ring. Directly
       attacking units outside of the ring should be very, very rare.
    *) May be impacted by status changes or special dynamics.
