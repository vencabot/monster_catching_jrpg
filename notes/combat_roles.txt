All class names are works in progress.

Defense Buffer:
    *) Raising defense of ally units
    *) Granting temporary invincibility to damage
    *) Can sacrifice its own defense to raise the defense of an ally
    *) Some invincibility only lasts for 1 attack
    *) Other invincibility only lasts for 1 turn

Status Change Stealer:
    *) Moves buffs and afflictions between characters in battle.

Pinner:
    *) It will prevent one unit on the enemy team from being swapped in.
    *) At a RELATIVELY LOW COST, it can target the unit in the ring so that, once it leaves, it can't come back in until cured.
    *) At a VERY HIGH cost, it can target a unit NOT in the ring to prevent it from entering the ring until cured.
    *) These abilities are going to be quite costly. Any class which DIRECTLY CONTROLS the opponent's OPTIONS on their turn is going to be very powerful in a game that's based as much around tactics and synergy as this game is.

Poisoner:
    *) Specializes in abilities that deal HP damage over time.
    *) Some of its abilities may be traps that the opponent must avoid
       springing.
    *) May afflict individual units or the enemy party, based on tier and
       cost.
    *) Poisons vary in potency and how hard they are to cure.
    *) These 'poisons' might only deal HP damage under certain circumstances
       (unit IN the ring for a turn, unit NOT in the ring for a turn, unit
       attacks DIRECTLY on this turn).

ATK Buffer:
    *) Raise the ATK of a single unit or multiple units.
    *) Give a unit a % chance to deal extra damage, but this buff lasts
       UNTIL this damage is triggered.
    *) Maybe it can give a unit an even GREATER BOOST, but at some cost to
       that unit, be it having lower DEF, or it takes damage when it
       attacks. It's a BIG boost, but at a cost. You could at this 'cost'
       group of abilities as making your team more aggression-oriented.

HP Healer:
    *) Can heal HP immediately or inflict a status change that heals over
       time.
    *) May also be able to set up "reverse trap," on ally units, where HP is
       healed when a certain condition is triggered.
    *) This same class would also revive downed units.
    *) Tertiary abilities could be any of the above, but at a very low
       potency, so the amount healed wouldn't be MUCH. Or it could be a
       relatively big heal but a high cost.
    *) Maybe even sacrifice own HP to heal.
    *) What if there was a class whose tertiary was to revive, and that's
       all it could do. Maybe a 'reviver' class?

Attackers that specialize in big damage over many hits?
Attackers that specialize in fairly high damage over single hits?
Healers that can reduce the duration of negative status changes.
Cheerleader class that can raise the duration of positive status changes.
Manipulator class that can raise/shorten the duration of any status change.
Dodger class that can give allies a % chance to dodge.
Berzerker class variants of attack classes that have a % chance to miss.
Piercer class whose abilities typically ignore defense.
An attacker that wounds itself, either for MP, HP, LP, etc., to do big damage.
Pinning unit which prevents the enemy from using a unit they want to use.
Pinning unit which prevents the opponent from swapping characters with some penalty. In that respect, it sets up traps.
What about a class which limits the opponent's use of their primary or secondary class? That seems really, really powerful; it would be on a very limited basis.
How about a 'reviver' class which doesn't really heal HP directly, but its reviving abilities are really good.

All of these classes / roles may end up bleeding into each other or taking on other functions, etc.
