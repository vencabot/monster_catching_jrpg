Our goal here is to make a monster-collecting JRPG in the style of games
like:
    Pokemon
    Dragon Quest Monsters
    Robopon
    Digimon
    Shin Megami
    Medabots

    Suikoden
    Chrono Cross
    Final Fantasy Type Zero
    Wild Arms 4
    Lufia 2
    Phantasy Star I (pay to revive characters)

//    Advance Wars
//    Front Mission
//    Ogre Battle
//    Final Fantasy Tactics
//    Shining Force
//    Valkyria Chronicles

We can broaden our horizons by looking at these not as "monster collecting"
games, but rather JRPGs where you have a LOT of characters that you can move
onto and off of your party.

Any game where your investment into an individual character isn't as
significant as the party-makeup that you decide on.

These are all games where your character-growth decisions are on a spectrum of
significance compared to what characters you choose to put on your party.

Another primary aspect of a "monster-collecting" game is the
monster-collection aspect. It's about traveling a game world and discovering
new characters to add to your party.

We need to have a LOT of characters.
The player needs to be incentivized to explore to COLLECT those characters.
There needs to be some interesting decisions to make regarding which
characters the player ends up using.

For the sake of simplicity, since the point of this game-development project
is for us to come together and learn about game-design, we should lay some
ground-rules so that we don't get too ambitious.

For instance, let's focus on 1-on-1 character battles (in the vein of
Pokemon).

Let's focus on the game being 2D. We're going to be developing the game using
Pygame, which is especially good at making 2D games.

If we're going to focus on making a one-on-one "monster battle" RPG, we
should look at what we can TAKE from these grid-based tactics JRPGs.

Character customization is strong in tactics-style games. But the downside of
this is that, in some of these, you end up using mostly the same team for the
whole game. So, maybe what we can take from that is that we need to strike a
balance between making it interesting to develop a character but also giving
each character some limits so that the player doesn't really want to use one
set of characters for the whole game.

We're gonna have a lot of characters to choose from, so it would make sense to
have a major of the part of the game being choosing which characters you want
to use for which situations.

An idea might be to have multiple teams. That way, you're incentivized to use
a wider variety of characters.

Following our tactics-game analogy, maybe we could think of each monster as
representing a 'class'. Every class has different tools, and they should all
be interesting, but you shouldn't be able to tackle every challenge in the
game using the same set of tools or classes.

What we're fixating on, right now, is how do you strike a balance between
making it to fun to grow a character but also not getting the player too
attached to that character, so they can still be swapped around.

In Pokemon 1st gen, you mostly just grind to level up characters, and that's
kind of boring. Aside from that, you can choose which skills they learn, and,
to an extent, when they evolve. I personally feel like Pokemon's approach to
character growth might be a bit TOO hands-off for this project.

On the other hand, we've listed a lot of games where the player is rewarded
for sticking with the same few characters for the whole game. In those games,
the characters can have their classes dramatically changed throughout the
game. They can be developed to fulfill a wide variety of needs. They can wear
all kinds of different equipment that can have an impact on their function. I
feel like that might be a bit TOO deep of growth per-character.

When a character levels up, what happens? What decisions does the player make
regarding character growth?

Let's dial it back. What decisions are coming into play when deciding which
characters you want to bring onto your party.

In Pokemon, you consider type-matchups. Certain types are weak or strong
against other types, and that's a major influence on what characters you
bring onto your party.

In classic JRPGs, a major factor of character choice would be your opponent's
defense weaknesses. Some enemies are weaker to physical attacks, or, more
specifically, 'blunt' attacks. Or 'piercing'. Or 'slashing' attacks. Or
magical attacks of a variety of elements. Maybe an opponent is especially
evasive, so you need a character that has a lot of accuracy. Or maybe they do
a lot of damage, so you need a character that has a lot of health or defense.

We're talking about choosing a team based on what types of opponents you
expect to fight.

Maybe, in each battle, the player will have to make some difficult decisions
regarding how to consume their characters' resources. Compare this to games in
the Final Fantasy franchise, where individual battles are sometimes trivial,
and if there are decisions to make regarding resource consumption (HP, SP,
MP), they're made over the course of dungeon rather than a single battle.

So maybe our fights could be longer, or maybe the party is somehow healed
between battles to encourage the player to consume their resources more
aggressively.

KG brings up the idea that we could solve some of our problems regarding
incentivizing the player to use a wider variety of characters by having some
characters be removed from the party when they die or something else happens
to permanently or temporarily remove them from the game.

Of course, in other games that use a mechanic like that, there becomes a
different decision-making process regarding how much to invest in a single
character when you know that you might not always be able to use them.

I really like the idea that KGtheLegend put forward: remove characters from
the party, in battle, on a permanent or semi-permanent basis as a way to
encourage the player to A.) be very careful regarding which characters they
pick to bring into battle, and B.) use more characters, because maybe
the player's original favorites might be incapacited.

At the same time, I feel like it might be a bit harsh to permanently remove a
character from the game, if only because that would have a lot influence over
the way that we design our character-growth mechanics. I feel like, if you
expect that your character might permanently die, we can't really ask the
player to invest too many decisions into that individual character's growth.

Maybe, when a character is "killed" or removed from the game, we can think of
some way for the player to "buy" them back. But the player wouldn't have
access to that character for some amount of time.

HereGoes mentions it would be cool to let the player choose their main
character.

Something that I think about, regarding monster-collection games like
Pokemon, is that the "protagonist" or "trainer" or whatever they may be
typically doesn't get a lot of mechanical growth.

In Pokemon, the character can train any number of monsters, but the trainer,
himself, doesn't really become any more powerful throughout the game.

If we allow the player to choose their own main character, maybe each
"trainer" or "protagonist" can have different mechanical attributes that
influence they way manage their team. Maybe the protagonist you choose
imparts some kind of bonus to your team, or maybe they can earn some kind of
currency (EXP, etc.) that they can use to enhance or otherwise give a bonus to
their entire team. That way, the protagonist can grow along with the
individual party members, AND there could be an interesting decision to be
made regarding WHICH main character you choose to play.

If we can have the player shift control between more than one protagnist,
that would definitely incentivize the player to experiment with different
team-layouts and monsters. In fact, maybe different protagonist have access to
different party members / monsters / classes , at least early-on, so the
player is encouraged to try new things and not just settle on one
team-makeup.

KD puts forth the idea of how much cooler Pokemon would be if we could
control the main character's party as well as the main antagonists' team.
That makes me think of how interesting to be to experiment with different
MEANS of COLLECTING your party members. In Pokemon, the trainer catches them
in the wild, in balls, but Team Rocket steal their monsters. That could be
interesting: you can choose between different protagonists -- maybe even more
than one in a single playthrough -- and perhaps one of the factors that sets
them apart is the condition they need to meet to add new characters to their
team.

Let's do a recap of what we fixated on the most, today:
    * Individual encounters being more resource-intensive than in more
      casual JRPGs. Maybe characters need to be sacrificed in order to win,
      sometimes. Maybe your 'mage' will have to totally exhaust their ammo.
      You might have to make more difficult decisions more often in combat.
      There are greater consequences for your decisions in individual
      encounters.

    * The player may be given the opportunity to choose between different
      protagonists, each of which may come with their own set of gameplay
      ramifications. Maybe they give their respective teams different buffs.
      Maybe the way that they collect new characters varies. Of course their
      narrative varies. These characters, themselves, can be grown in a
      way that's distinct from the way that the individual "monsters" grow.
      Maybe, when your protagonist dies, you can pick up from another
      characters' perspective.

    * Between the fact that you might have multiple teams (one for each
      protagonist) and each of those teams, because of the trainer's bonus,
      will incentivize different types of play, and because characters might
      need to be sacrificed in battle on a semi-regular basis, we've got
      some pretty strong incentive for the player to utilize a larger
      percentage of the game's available monsters / classes.

    * Although we discussed the idea of removing characters from the party
      as a way to make combat more interesting and to encourage the player
      to not overly rely on the same small team, perhaps the player can buy
      back "dead" characters or otherwise earn them back onto the team after
      some amount of time or difficult trial has been passed. That way,
      although the player will definitely need to replace their party-member
      on a temporary basis, they might feel safer to invest more into a
      characters' development, knowing that they won't PERMANENTLY die.

    * OhSeraph shared some really awesome musical contributions that really
      acted as a lot of inspiration for our game, in terms of narrative and
      gameplay style.

Look at 'evoland,' as mentioned by Zanzhu.






02/04/19

If we're making a JRPG (and we are), we could think of the issues of 'balance' as being issues of 'classes' or 'jobs' (in Final Fantasy).

We've been comparing our game to Pokemon, which is something you gotta do, but if we're speaking in broader terms, you could look at each Pokemon as falling into a certain class. Some Pokemon are 'warriors'. Some are 'wizards'. There's even a couple 'healers'. Some could be as thought of as 'rogues,' because they might have low physical attack by high critical.

Let's talk about our combat. How do you guys envision combat actually playing out? What's the UI like? How do you control your character? What sorts of things can your character do, and what can the opponent do?

I decided early on, for the sake of simplicity, that we'd be working with 1-on-1 battles in the same style as Pokemon. In Pokemon, you have a team, and your team make-up is significant, but in the first generation especially, combat is a 1-on-1 affair, and both teams can swap characters in and out. It's sort of like a tag battle, basically.

If we have one-on-one tag battles, how is the make-up of your team important?

In Pokemon, the real significance of your team is based on 'type-matchups'. So, certain characters are particularly strong or weak against other character types, and so you're mostly just swapping characters around to work around these simplistic type match-ups.

I think we should be a little more creative than that.

Austin recommends something sort of similar to Pokemon's 'type-matchup' system, where a character might do 'slashing' damage and the opponent's armor might be resistant or vulnerable to that type of damage.

Immediately, I want to point out that I like this idea more than Pokemon's type system right off the bat. Because, in Pokemon, your 'type' is one-dimensional. It affects the sorts of attacks you DO and the sorts of damage you TAKE. If our characters can have a sort of 'weapon' (whether it be 'equipped' or just a permanent part of the character) and a sort of 'armor', we get more variety in our match-ups.

Austin's talking about 'jobs' as well. I recently played through a monster-collecting JRPG called World of Final Fantasy. As compared to Pokemon, WoFF allowed you to give your monsters 'classes'. It was sort of like how Pokemon 'evolve' into stronger and slightly different types, except that you could also devolve. You could move between forms, and skills that you learned in one form could sort of be applied to another form, sort of like traditional multi-classing in RPGs.

Another concern we have is that, if individual monsters are too interesting and can be customized too much, it would defy the need to switch characters. Every character needs to have some limit to what their role is capable of so that the player is encouraged to swap them around to create an ideal deck for different situations. If characters are too flexible, there's no need for that.

On the other hand, if characters are TOO LIMITED, they won't be interesting to micro-manage. In Pokemon, your characters basically only level up from experience. And they MIGHT learn a couple of different skills that you can choose from. For the most part, though, you don't really have any agency over the way they grow.

BestMatchup put forward the idea of, at least internally, within our team, coming up with a set of 'roles' that 'monsters' can fit into. Maybe the particulars of how they go about fulfilling that role can vary DRAMATICALLY, but, as game designers, maybe we can think of the different 'pokemon' or 'classes' or whatever you want to call them as fitting into a set of roles.

Let's talk about how combat is going to play out.

In Pokemon, when you swap characters to create a better match-up for yourself, you incur a penalty. That's a big part of how Pokemon battles play out: although you have a team of six, and you can bring any of those creatures out into battle, one-at-a-time, you cannot attack on the same turn that you swap characters, so your opponent gets a free hit on you. That's a MAJOR DISINCENTIVE to swap characters. You really want to put a lot of strategy into the order that you send your characters out in.

Is that something that we want to copy? Or do we want to make it more free for the player to swap characters? If they can swap characters too freely, how is that dissimilar from an RPG where you control the entire party at once?

We've got 1-on-1 battles, but if characters can be swapped without a penalty, how do we determine, for instance, which character is taking damage from the opponent on THIS turn? If I want to use a 'healer' character to heal the 'tank' character, that makes the healer vulnerable to damage, right? We swap out the tank for the healer, and the healer casts some kind of spell, but now the healer is vulnerable because they just took an action?

We're kind of working within the idea of a one-on-one combat system where characters are tagged in-and-out.

I'm not sure I understand Kenny and Austin's suggestion in the chat, but what I get from it is, what if you could, like, have the tank take a hit, and then quickly swap out to the healer, who could use a healing skill, and then we could swap the tank back in before the opponent gets their turn?

The core riddle of our combat gameplay is that characters who are not tagged in are not vulnerable, which is great for us, but they also can't act, which sucks for us. So, there's a risk-reward with having any character take an action, because, to take an action, they have to be tagged in. And if they're tagged in, they're vulnerable to damage.

We're talking about, in one-on-one tag battles, how do we make the party dynamic more interesting.

Austin phrases his idea like this, "You have a timer of 25 seconds. If you swap a character out at, say, 10 seconds, the time could still be going while you swap. Then, you have whatever time is left to complete your turn."

In Austin's example, we're talking about LITERAL SECONDS. And that's what Kenny and I are talking about: the tactical difference between real-time and wait-time battles.

I think what Austin's suggestion could be interpreted as, in a more abstract sense, is that, on a turn, you're given a certain amount of resources (seconds). Different actions can consume a different amount of those resources (different attacks take different amounts of time). On your turn, you can take any number of actions as long as they fit within that resource limit (you can do as many things as you want as long as you have time on your turn).

If we were going to make this into slower-paced, tactical battles, we could give the player something like "AP". Every turn, you get 25 "AP". You can do whatever you want with that AP, including swapping characters -- but when you run out of AP, whoever is left tagged in is vulnerable to the opponent's turn.

What's kind of cool about that is that maybe different protagonists have different amounts of that resource.

Another trapping of our game-design philosophy that I want to point out: because we're in the 'monster collecting' genre, our opponents will have access to the same tools we do. It's not like Final Fantasy, where our team consists of "characters" and the enemy team consists of baddies that deal in different growth mechanics. The enemy units, in our game, will consist of the same types of units that we have access to. So our units will be balanced to fight each other, at some point.

I feel like we've made some good progress. Let's recap:

* Combat starts with our team's turn. On our turn, we have a certain amount of time (25 seconds). Different actions take different amounts of time, and, once we're out of time, the opponent gets their turn. And the loop continues.

* Only the character who took the last action on a turn is vulnerable to the opponent. It's tag-based combat, so a major of the strategy will be to organize the actions on your turn so that the last action leaves the character vulnerable that you want to be vulnerable.

* Obviously, more powerful actions will consume more time. Maybe some actions will be especially useful because they take a very little amount of time.

* Perhaps different 'protagonists' or 'trainers' might have different amounts of time to take their turn. Some heavy-hitting protagonists might get a bonus to aggression for their whole team, but they'll have less time to choose multiple actions.

Kenny puts forth the question: should there be a bonus for not using all of your AP. I say no, there shouldn't be. I want to encourage the player to consume all of their resources. I don't want to reward the player for saving and being conservative. I want for the player to feel at liberty to use everything they have. The fights are gonna be really difficult, ideally; I would like for them to be so strenuous that the player always wishes they had more AP. I don't want them to feel at liberty to not use their entire turn so that they can get some kind of bonus.

If we penalize the player for NOT using their AP, we're adding a whole different dimension of difficulty to the game, because now they have to do math on every turn to make sure that they get everything done they WANT to get done, AND end their turn on the character that they want to be vulnerable, AND they use ENOUGH of the CORRECT skills to consume as much of their AP has possible. Then we're looking at skills whose entire purpose is to dump AP for that purpose. I'm not sure I'm 100% on board with that idea, but it is VERY interesting.

We're talking with HereGoes and Kenny in the chat: should swapping characters consume AP.

There's two ways to look at this problem, and it's all based around how many actions a single character can effectively take in a single turn. If each character is really only good for ONE skill that they have, then you really can't charge for swapping.

On the other hand, if it's interesting to the player for a character to take more than one action while they're tagged in, maybe it would make combat MORE interesting to charge for swapping. That way, the player has some incentive to utilize a single character's abilities more effectively.

Both sides of the battle will follow exactly the same rules.

We're discussing in the roles in the chat, again. Maybe different units have 'primary' roles, 'secondary' roles, and maybe even 'tertiary' roles -- and the skills they can learn are based on these roles. Maybe if you have a certain role as your 'secondary,' you don't have access to the most powerful skills of that role -- and if it's your tertiary, you only have access to the most basic skills of that role. You can then mix-and-match skills from the various roles, but whatever role is your 'primary' is likely to give you the most powerful and useful skills.

BestMatchup recommends an idea where the player is encouraged to inflict some minimum amount of damage to the enemy team or else they get some kind of bonus on their next turn.

BUT WHAT IF the protagonist or 'trainer' that you choose determines what sort of condition you have for getting a bonus in battle. Maybe some trainers get a bonus if their team doesn't take enough damage on the previous turn. Maybe other trainers get a bonus if their team doesn't take damage of a certain element on their turn. Maybe another trainer gets a bonus if the opposing team has some number of status ailments on their team.

This would encourage a variety of different playstyles not only because you want the bonus for YOUR team, which means meeting certain conditions, but also because you want to PREVENT your opponent from getting THEIR bonus by interrupting THEIR conditions.

HereGoes talks about Persona as a sort of groundwork for looking at how different characters can fill more than one role, even if they're not equally effective at all roles. One of my favorite games of all time, Final Fantasy XIII, does something very similar, where characters they have the potential to fill certain roles, but not EVERY role, and they specialize in one role in particular.

We could look at every 'monster' (Pokemon, yokai) as having a certain 'role' which determines which skillsets they have access to -- and maybe they have more limited access to their 'secondary' and maybe 'tertiary' skillsets.

I kinda like this idea because choosing skills from a set adds interest to the micro-management aspect, and that's something that I'd really like to have in the game.

Like we mentioned earlier, Pokemon doesn't really have a lot of micro-management. The monsters in that game are pretty set in stone. You just pick the monsters you want, and that's the limit of your party design. On the other hand, if you have too much freedom to micro-manage an individual monster, it discourages you from ever having to swap party members. You could be set to complete the game with just one party.

As we continue to look at ways that your 'trainer' or 'leader' could have perks that affect your whole team, RedPanders brings up the idea that maybe you could have a trainer that empowers the skills or characters that fit a certain 'role' or 'class' or 'type'.

I think, personally, it'd be more interesting to have an AP penalty for swapping characters. It means that you have to be more careful about when you swap, and it means that, when you tag someone in, you probably want to make the most use of their skills that you can before swapping again.

The alternative would be to look at every character as though they were an ability, and you can swap them in and out freely on your turn to use their respective abilities in any order.

But, you know, if you charge the player to tag, that makes it more difficult to end the turn on your tank, which I think is interesting.

The AP, as the 'turn currency', is not something that is intrinsic to the monster / unit. The turn currency is attached to the trainer / leader. Although, maybe monsters / units could have some kind of attribute (speed?) that acts as a multiplier for their ability cost in AP. So, maybe a very 'fast' unit could conduct the same action as a 'slow' unit, but it would cost less AP.

Today, I'm really glad that we've focused more on combat flow, because I really wanted to talk about that and nail some things down. Here's what we've discussed so far:

* Because we're a 'monster collecting JRPG,' our player characters will form a 'team' or a 'deck' of units / monsters. Even though we're talking about 'teams' using the same nomenclature as those of team-based RPGs like 'Final Fantasy' or 'Breath of Fire' or 'Persona,' our combat is ONE-ON-ONE. It's a tag-based system that you could think of as theoretically taking place in a wrestling ring. Only one character from each team can be in the ring at the same time, and only the character that's in the ring can take an action or take damage.

* When the leader's turn begins, whatever unit is currently tagged in can take any number of actions, all of which will draw from that leader's pool of 'AP' (turn currency). Those same actions might also draw from the unit's 'MP' or 'SP' or 'ammo'. As long as the leader has AP, they can use that AP to tag in another character from the team, who can then continue using up the AP with THEIR abilities.

* So, unlike Pokemon, our turn is not consumed by taking a single action. In Pokemon, you have turns that go back and forth between two opposing characters that can be swapped for another unit on their team, but each of those characters can only take ONE action before their turn is consumed. In our game, the leader can instruct their team to take any number of actions on a single turn until their AP is consumed.

Although only the 'tagged in' character can directly take damage or be targeted for traditional 'status changes' (poison, paralyze, whatever), I like the idea that some skills might passively affect either the ALLY party or the ENEMY party. Maybe, by having a certain character on your team, all characters on the team get a buff. Maybe by using a certain ABILITY, as HereGoes says, maybe you can exert some control over how your opponent tags characters. Maybe you can make tagging cost more AP. Maybe you can lock a certain character on their team from being tagged in for the next turn.

So, even though only the tagged characters can take or deal damage, there may never-the-less be some mechanisms at play that have a broader effect on a team.

BestMatchup raises the idea of 'counter attacks' or 'counter reactions' of some kind that take place when the enemy takes a certain action.

I want to talk more about that when we have the time to look more in-depth at how our characters are going to grow and be customized. I'm going to say, one more time, because I do think it's very important and worth reiterating, that there's a very careful balance to be struck between having a lot of agency over how individual characters GROW (because that's interesting and fun), but also limiting that agency -- limiting the ways that we can customize our characters -- to encourage the player to constantly be changing their party layout to make the most of MASSIVE roster of potential units (because we're a monster-collecting JRPG), because THAT'S fun and interesting.

So we want to strike a balance between having it be interesting to micro-manage individual units, but also have it not be so flexible that the player doesn't feel like they ever need to try using a different type of unit.

So, in the future, we're really going to dedicate a lot of thought to how our characters -- whether we're talking about 'leaders' or 'units' -- grow.

Certain units have abilities that debuff untagged units (but these should be very rare). It's very interesting, but it undermines the idea that untagged units should be more-or-less safe, and the risk-reward of the game comes from wanting to use a unit's abilities but not wanting them to be left tagged into the arena at the end of the turn, where they'll be vulnerable.

Kenny puts forth the idea, which he says is inpsired by FF6, that some dungeons or tasks or scenarios may require the player to use more than one team.

Although we haven't put the idea forward strictly speaking, up to this point, I think that it more-or-less goes without saying, because I really like the idea of the player taking charge of more than one leader, and, by extension, more than one team. I feel like, with different leaders imparting their team with different perks, this will really help the player explore a wider variety of unit types -- which is our goal. If we're going to design 100 different unit types, we want to encourage the player to try them all and find out which leaders they work best with and how best to use them in a team. So it makes sense, then, to have the player control multiple leaders and their teams to complete a single scenario.

Although we're not going to have individual COMBAT sections where more than one team fights on the same side at once, we may very well have concurrent or related fights where the player will be moving between teams for different fights.

To be clear, more powerful abilities will consume more of the turn's AP, and / or more ammo from the unit.

The idea was brought up that maybe, for the sake of simplicity, the individual monsters don't level up -- rather, the leader levels up, and all of the units that they're leading might have power reflecting the level of their leader.

I kind of like the idea that, maybe, you have a certain amount of 'skill points' or 'level points' to distribute to your team mates based on the level of your leader. This idea really appeals to me because it encourages the player to swap out units regularly without having to worry about whether or not some unit has been grinded up to par.



02/06/2019:

After reading last night's discourse on the Discord server, one thing that I do want to emphasize is that, to me, a good game isn't made by its story or its individual mechanics. Those are definitely major factors that can enhance the experience of playing a game, but what 'gameplay' boils down to, for me, is pretty simple:

It's how interesting the player's decisions are. How difficult those decisions are to make. How impactful the consequences of those decisions are. How often the player gets to make these decisions. Are those decisions really impactful or worthwhile.

* Zanzhu brings up the idea that maybe, whether or not a character is 'sacrificed' or is 'destroyed' or otherwise falls in combat, maybe the player only has access to them for some limited amount of time. His example is Jagged Alliance 2, where units are hired for some length of contract and then have to be re-hired.

We're discussing the idea of binding a unit to a particular object as a way to make gameplay more interesting (and this would also impact the narrative).

Points that I would like make about this idea:

* When binding a 'character' to something that's more disposable, it allows us to think about 'durability' as an attribute of a character. Maybe they only last a certain amount of time. They're destructible.

* It allows us to forgo the trappings of RPGs that have smaller parties and more micro-management per-character. In Final Fantasy, you only have six units, and so it makes sense to worry about things like what weapon they're holding AND what armor they're wearing AND what accessory they have on. In a game where we're going to have maybe more than a hundred characters, maybe they don't individually have armor and such that can be swapped, but maybe, when you recruit them, you have to pick an item that will influence their growth -- and that could be your decision that's parallel to 'equipment' in other RPGs. But because you can't change it, it encourages to recruit more units and try different things.

* These 'sparked' or 'bindable' objects could effectively act as treasure for the player to find or buy with currency. That's kind of interesting: you have a collection of 'spirits' that you've recruited, but you also have a collection of objects that you can use to bind them together.






Before we call it a day, I had an idea that I'm afraid I'm gonna forget if I don't write it down:

* In combat, we talked about how the player has a certain of 'AP' or 'turn currency', and they can use that currency to act multiple times with the in-ring character or they can tag another character into the ring, and whoever is left in the ring when the turn currency runs dry is going to have to face the aggression of the opponent. We also, on Discord, discussed the possibility of giving the leader some actions that can consume AP.

That being case, I had the idea of having a bonus to action effectiveness that goes up as the remaining AP of the turn goes down. So, the less AP you have remaining when you take an action, the more powerful that action is. I think that's interesting because it adds a risk-reward element where your most powerful action is the last one you take, and so your most 'aggressive' character or your 'healer' might be left in the ring to take the opponent's assault. By extension, 'tank' characters would have to have pretty lame abilities so that it'd be a tough decision to end the turn with THEM in the ring, because you'd be sacrificing more damage or healing or whatever that you could've gotten if you ended the turn with a non-tank characters in the ring.


* Panders also brings up that there's already a disincentive to end the turn on a tank: if it costs AP to tag other characters in, then you're going to have to tag someone else in at the START of your next turn, because you probably don't want to spend the whole turn as the tank. So, if you're super conservatively, every turn would start with swapping the tank OUT and then end with swapping the tank back IN, which could be expensive.




What Kenny said about his uncertainty toward the narrative idea of the protagonists being able to 'gift' their power: if they could do that, you'd think it'd be more of a part of the game.

Up to this point, we've sort of been looking at the idea of 'multiple team leaders' or 'protagonists' as being closely tied to the story. But what if the player could make a choice about which characters he gives this power to, and that would tie into our idea of having several different 'leaders' who all have their own perks, and growth trees, other buffs for their team: maybe the player has to decide which of these characters and their respective play-styles to 'activate'. In this example, we wouldn't just be playing as the main protagonist and the rest of their group or family, but we'd be playing as the main protagonist and whoever the player chooses to gift their power to.

Maybe the character choices (narrative decisions) that a character makes could influence what sorts of units or classes or whatever that playable character has access to. Their personality affects their team structure, essentially.

Steve points out that it's kind of a cool idea that our playable characters represent a diverse number of objectives that may be 'good' or 'evil' or otherwise personally motivated. They're all personally motivated.





02/11/2019

Today, we're going to be talking more in-depth about our game's primary combat system. Before I start rattling off new ideas, let's review what we already know about our combat:

*) Combat is 1v1 tag-style, similar to Pokemon. Only one character from each
   team can be taking action at one time.

*) Unlike Pokemon, characters can take more than one action per turn and can
   even tag in another character on the same turn. This is accomplished
   through an 'AP' system, where the 'trainer' starts each turn with a
   certain amount of AP to spend on turn-actions and the turn is only over
   when they either run out of AP or choose to end their turn.

*) AP cannot be saved between turns. This is meant to encourage the player
   to choose their actions carefully to consume as much of their AP each
   turn as possible.

*) Although unit actions all cost AP, as well as tagging, there are some
   actions that the leader character can take to consume AP as well. This
   might include using items or even calling upon special skills, although
   these skills would need to be fairly limited so that the player can't
   over-rely on them. The advantage of these skills would be that they can
   be used regardless of which unit is currently in the ring.

That's what we know as of right now. Here are some points that have been on my mind over the weekend:

*) I think that every unit in the game should have available skills from 3
   different 'classes'.

*) Basically, every 'class' in the game would be a list of abilities to be
   used in combat, and these abilities would be sorted in order of useful-
   ness or power or effectiveness. They'd be sorted into three groups:
   'Primary' abilities, 'Secondary' abilities, and 'Tertiary' abilities.

*) Each unit would have a 'Primary' class, 'Secondary' class, and 'Tertiary'
   class. The unit would have access to all of the abilities from their
   'Primary' class, the 'Secondary' and 'Tertiary' abilities from their
   'Secondary' class, and only the Tertiary abilities of their Tertiary
   class.

*) In Pokemon, it seems like the abilities that each Pokemon has access to
   is random or hand-picked for that unit. In our game, there would be a
   rigid set of classes which have access to certain abilities, and the
   abilities that a unit would have access to would be entirely based on
   their combination of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary classes.

*) I think that would make balance and the decisions of who goes onto your
   team a little bit easier.

*) In Pokemon (and a lot of other JRPGs), there is a lot of cross-over in
   the intended usage of certain abilities. You'll almost always have a ton
   of skills that deal a small amount of physical damage. You'll also have
   a lot of cross-over in 'magic' skills, usually because they're of
   different 'elements'. I would really like it if we could minimize the
   amount of cross-over between abilities. I would like to avoid abilities
   that are just stronger versions of other abilities, which we may intend
   to be unlocked later. Ideally, every ability would have a unique and
   valuable purpose.

*) As a part of that, I think that we can give abilities interesting costs
   so that we can afford the player a variety of tactical options to go
   about accomplishing what they want to accomplish. For instance, we know
   that all abilities will carry an AP cost (which eventually brings about
   the end of the leader's turn). However, maybe they may also be balanced
   against having a limited number of uses per fight, or per turn. Maybe
   some abilities consume ammo that the unit is carrying (such as 'MP').
   Maybe some abilities consume HP, or will afflict an ally unit with a
   negative status change. Maybe using the ability will cost your entire
   party 5% of their HP. This is sort of an unusual way of looking at Skill
   cost in a JRPG, but I think that if we balance abilities against a
   variety of interesting costs, it'll make tactical decisions in combat
   more interesting.

*) Panders brings up the idea that maybe the 'Tertiary' abilities could be
   assigned to a unit NOT by their 'monster type,' but by some external
   factor, such as their equipment or something. In the past, I've pushed
   to have their equipment be permanently attached to them and affect their
   growth in some way, but I also feel like the idea of having it affect
   their Tertiary abilities could be interesting. On the other hand, the
   Tertiary abilities are kind of meawnt to be the least-interesting
   abilities. I sort of imagine the Tertiary abilities as being a minor way
   to impact battle and, maybe most importantly of all, a way to consume the
   remaining AP in a turn.

*) With respect for the fact that the 'Tertiary' abilities are only going to
   provide a very small augmentation to your overall strategy, I don't see
   why you shouldn't be allowed to define it, yourself, by choosing which
   equipment is bound to your units.

*) I also think that individual units could have a special 'perk' that
   gives them some unique property in battle. Previously, we talked about
   how each 'trainer' or 'leader' character could come with certain perks or
   passive traits or qualities that will influence the sorts of strategies
   you might use when bringing that leader (and their team) into battle.
   But I also think it could add interest to the experience of designing a
   party if each unit had one special trait that would affect how you use
   them in a team. Maybe they could passively buff the entire party by some
   small amount. Maybe they're an extremely powerful unit, but bringing them
   into the team results in some DEBUFF to either them or the party. Maybe
   some units, in battle, could debuff the enemy party just by being there.
   Maybe some traits are triggered only when a unit is in the ring, or maybe
   it triggers every time they're swapped into or out of the ring. The
   possibilities are endless.

*) So basically, what we know about 'units' so far is that they:
    *) Have some base attributes which affect their growth. JRPG stuff.
    *) Naturally have access to two classes' worth of abilities, but have
       restricted access to the abilities of their 'Secondary' class.
    *) They have a single piece of equipment permanently bound to them,
       which augments the attributes they get when they level-up and
       provides the unit with a 'Tertiary' class, which is even more
       restricted than their secondary class.
    *) They have a single 'perk' or 'passive' that makes the unit more
       interesting, tactically.
    *) The MAIN THING that we need to know is what 'attributes' or 'stats'
       our units have which will play out in battle.

*) For individual 'abilities', here's what we know so far:
    *) Abilities are attached to classes and are ranked in order of impact
       as 'Primary,' 'Secondary,' and 'Tertiary.'
    *) We know that every ability comes with one or more costs. At the very
       least, each ability costs some amount of the leader's AP to use, but
       they'll also have other costs and limitations associated with them.
       These could be of a huge variety of things. Basically, when you use
       an ability, there's gonna be a trade-off which is probably pro-
       portional to how powerful the ability is.
    *) Maybe some abilities have a limited number of usages per battle or
       per turn.

Panders brings up the idea that maybe abilities can be 'super charged' to
have greater effectiveness at some (relatively small) cost. An ability can
be powered up more or less based on whether it's in that units' Primary,
Secondary, or Tertiary class.

I think this is an awesome idea, but it also adds a lot of complexity (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). I feel like, 'boosted' abilities probably should have special qualities to them aside from just doing more damage or healing more health. Which would make it difficult to balance them all. On the other, maybe they don't need that, and perhaps you can only power-up lower-level abilities. Maybe, if 'Warrior' is your Primary Class, you can power-up Warrior's secondary abilities by 1 level and their tertiary abilities by 2 levels, essentially bringing them closer to the power of a primary ability.

Panders goes on to clarify that he's talking about essentially putting all abilities on the same level of usefulness (tertiary), but having some abilities (those ranked as 'Primary' or 'Secondary') be buffable to effectively make them much more useful, whether this be done on-the-fly during the turn (which would afford a HUGE amount of tactical power, maybe too much), or whether it be done on a permanent-basis while managing the character outside of battle. Effectively choosing how much AP some of their abilities will cost in exchange for making them more powerful.

I feel like we have a pretty well-rounded view of what makes units and leaders interesting, and we have a broad view of

Effectively choosing how much AP some of their abilities will cost in exchange for making them more powerful.

In general, I feel like we've got a broad idea of how combat is going to play out. In fact, I think we're almost ready to start designing classes (and, from there, we can start designing units). But we really need to decide on what kind of 'attributes' or 'stats' our units have so that we can get a deep-enough understanding of what sorts of situations might occur in combat to the point that we can really think about what classes will make the most sense.

    *) 'HP' is the amount of damage a unit can take before they fall. Many
       attacks will deal HP damage directly, and combat is over once all of
       the units on one team have had their HP reduced to 0. 'HP' is
       essentially directly tied to the 'win condition' of combat. A unit
       with high HP might be used effectively to absord damage for other
       units.

    *) 'ATK' is the indicator of how much damage a unit can do with direct,
       (physical?) attack abilities. A unit with high 'ATK' will likely be
       used to deal HP damage directly to the enemy team, where-as other
       units might have the responsibility of recovering from the opponent's
       turn or setting up an ATK unit to deal damage.

Here's a question: do we want for units to have 'elemental weaknesses'. I've played many RPGs where elemental weaknesses have been a factor that have been all-too-easy to ignore. They didn't add anything interesting to the gameplay. On the other hand, I've played games where 'elemental' and other weaknesses were HUGELY integral to combat and played a big factor in what skills and equipment my characters used. Even then, although I've enjoyed these games, I'm not 100% sold that seeing that my opponent has an elemental weakness really gave me an interesting decision to make.

The ultimate sinner in this regard, in my opinion, is the Final Fantasy franchise, which is considered to be among the most important JRPG franchises. In those games, you almost always have a class in the vein of 'black mage,' which has access to all of the elemental magics. So attacking the enemy's weakness is as simple as choosing the right spell. They all have the same cost. They're all virtually the same: they just have different names and hurt different foes. It's not that interesting.

And in other games where you might know, in advance, that enemies are weak to fire, you might make the prudent decision to outfit your team with fire-infused weapons. You're doing more damage. You're rewarded for your foresight. But if you could've won just as easily without equipping 'fire swords,' there's really no point. On the other hand, if you can't easily win without equipping 'fire swords,' then it's basically mandatory, and the decision to equip swords isn't that interesting.

In Pokemon, I feel like it falls into the latter-side of the 'fire sword' example above. Types are everything in Pokemon (Gen 1), and FREQUENTLY result in one-shot kills. So, the bulk of the 'tactics' is just knowing what element your opponent is going to be using and picking the opposite element. That's not interesting. It actually sucks energy AWAY from the tactical side of the game. I wouldn't want for elemental weaknesses to take away from the interesting decisions you make. If it's going to be a factor, it would need to make the game MORE interesting.

I've been using the term 'elemental,' since it's most common in JRPGs, but that's the same for units that are weak to 'smash' damage or 'pierce' damage. Some RPGs basically apply 'elements' to physical attacks as well, and it's basically the same.

If we're looking at ways that elemental weaknesses (and strengths) could make tactics MORE interesting, I think it's interesting that, if you know the enemy team has a unit with abilities that one of your team members is weak against, you have to be more careful about when you send your unit out. That's kind of interesting. That adds a layer of tactics.

*) As a sub-note, maybe part of what makes elements less interesting in 'Pokemon', for me, is that every creature in the game has a strict list of things that they're strong and weak against, and most of the good abilities in the game play into that system.

*) Maybe we could implement elemental strengths and weaknesses on a scale that isn't a factor for every single match-up in the game.

*) Maybe we could balance it such that NOT EVERY UNIT has any elemental
   strength or weakness. In fact, maybe it could be somewhat rare.

*) For instance, maybe we have a unit that's otherwise very powerful. It's
   got good abilities and good stats. One of its downsides, however, is that
   its weak in certain match-ups in a way that not every unit has to worry
   about.

*) That being the case, maybe every (or most) units should deal some
   'elemental' damage, but it only has a negative (or positive) impact on
   certain, special units.

As I say it out loud, we run into a dilemma. I kinda like the idea we've described above, but the issue arises that if you KNOW what kinds of units you're going to be facing in an upcoming challenge, you could hypothetically rig your team such that you're taking advantage of the match-ups in a way that might be overly-simplified (our team will take less damage, now, or do more damage).

I feel like it makes the most sense when you don't know what's coming. Then, you're sort of taking a risk by bringing a certain unit onto your party. That's what I like about it. If you know what units are coming (which is very likely, unless every fight's units are 100% randomized), then you can start abusing the system to give yourself an advantage that isn't all that interesting.

What Panders is saying is that every dungeon could have a wide variety of elemental units. That way, you're not just saying, "Oh, I'm going into the volcano. I better not bring any ice types, because everything there is a fire-type."

I honestly think it would be more interesting if things like 'elemental weakness' and 'elemental strength', or 'elemental defense' and 'elemental attack' were attached directly to the UNIT, for all attacks they do and all damage they take. I don't think I want to fuck around too much with 'elements' on the scale of individual abilities. I don't think I want for there to be a 'black mage' class that has access to all of the elements. I think it makes for more interesting decisions -- greater consequences -- if the unit, itself, always attacks with some element and they're always weak (or strong) to some other element.

On that note, maybe the 'equipment' that a unit is permanently bound to might impact their elemental standing, in rare cases. We talked before about how every unit will have some 'perk' or 'passive'. Maybe that's where elemental stuff goes? Or maybe not; it could just be a generic attribute that all units share, but it's much less significant for most units.

Let's go back to attributes:
    *) HP
    *) OFF, which is just 'attack power.' Do we really need a different stat
       for 'physical attack' and 'magic attack'? Because, in JRPGs, how
       often does one unit take interesting advantage of both 'physical' and
       'magic' attack? Maybe we just need one 'offense' stat and their
       classes will determine what kind of attack that is. I don't think we
       really need to differentiate between 'magic' attacks and 'physical'
       attacks, right?

Panders brings up the point that, when you have two different attack stats (physical and magic), you can also have two different DEFENSE stats (physical and magic). So, a character that's got a lot of physical defense might be weak to an opponent who has a lot of magical attack. But this ties right back into what we were just saying about 'rock paper scissors' and whether or not that makes the game more interesting or less interesting.

We gotta bring in 'MP,' because I think that's an interesting way for some attacks to have a cost. We talked, above, about how, in our game, abilities could have a TON of different costs. They could have a limited number of uses per encounter or per turn, they might draw from the unit's HP or give the entire TEAM some status ailment. There's all kinds of costs for using abilities. By implementing 'MP,' I think we can strike a cool balance, because these attacks might have unlimited usages 'per encounter' or 'per turn,' but, by requiring MP to use, that will limit what OTHER abilities you use on your NEXT turn.

In Pokemon, every ability can only be used so many times before the Pokemon rests. This is also the behavior in most Dark Souls games and many classic pen-and-paper RPGs: you can only use EACH ability so many times.

What's cool about MP is that you can use any INDIVIDUAL ability however you want, but it will have a cost in the TOTAL NUMBER OF ABILITIES that you use before resting. You don't have 10 uses of 'Heal' and 10 uses of 'Thunder'. You have to choose between Heal and Thunder because of your MP limit.

So, it's a different kind of cost. It's a cost that's balanced against all of your other skills. I like that as an option for how to give certain abilities a cost.

Panders brings up the idea that maybe units can have a limit to how many actions they can take per turn. So, a unit with higher 'agility' might have a tactical advantage over a unit with lower agility because the unit with higher agility can take more actions before having to be tagged out (or before the end of the turn).

On the surface, I can see how that could lead to some interesting decisions. On the other hand, I also feel like, over-all, it probably lowers the amount of interesting decisions, and here's how:

It makes the most sense to me to balance "how many actions a single unit does per turn" with the fact that you WANT to tag another character in because of what we hope will be some tense tactical complexity in the game. In fact, we're even implementing a strict AP cost for tagging another unit in, because players are gonna WANT to tag in more units so they can use a wider variety of class abilities in a single turn, or make sure that a character with high DEF/HP is in the ring at the end of the turn.

Really, I've been look the idea of a single unit doing several actions in one turn as being a compromise. I feel like, in most cases, you're not going to want to have a single unit take more than one action, and if that's what they're doing, it's because you're trying to burn AP since you can't afford to swap in another character or you can't afford to swap a character in that would be safe if they were left in the ring for the next opponent turn. That being the case, I think a major part of the strategy of the game would be knowing which of your units has the most potential for taking multiple actions per turn. Like, you might want to swap in Unit A because they have a really cool ability you want to use, but you know that you'd need to swap in Unit B before the end of the turn, which means that you'd be wasting a lot of AP with swapping. So, you make the tough decision to swap in Unit C, who might not be quite AS useful, but he can do a variety of things: he's a jack of all trades and a master of none. It's a compromise to swap in Unit C, but it can do several things in one turn.

If a Leader character could only use a certain number of unit abilities per turn, it would encourage them to use bigger, more AP-intensive abilities. It would limit their tactical flexibility (which I think of as a good thing, in many cases), which could be cool. Maybe, instead of this being a trait of a Leader character, maybe it's a status ailment. Maybe a leader can be inflicted with an ailment that only allows them to use two unit abilities per turn, so now they have to make the difficult decision of which two to use to get the maximum effectiveness and consume as much AP as you can with only two abilities.

We've got these attributes for our units, basically:
    HP
    DEF
    OFF
    MP
    LP (Life Points)

    ATTACK ELEMENT
    ELEMENTAL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
    PERK
    Primary, Second, and Tertiary classes
    Once piece of permanent equipment which affects their growth, their
    tertiary class, their elements -- whatever.

'LP' is an attribute that is reduced by '1' every time your unit's HP hits zero, and certain rare, high-cost abilities can also reduce it directly. When a unit's LP reaches zero, it can't be revived, any more. We've previously talked about 'durability' in our game, and the possibility that units may die on a semi-permanent basis. Maybe 'LP' is how that works -- or, it could just be automatically restored at the end of every fight, and it only prevents a unit from being revived during THAT fight. But I kinda like the former idea: it's how they get 'destroyed' and then you need to painstakingly buy them back and replace them on your team for a while.




02/13/19

Let's review the attributes that our units have (and maybe the ones that our 'leaders' have as well):

Units:
    HP - The maximum amount of damage the unit can take before falling.
    DEF - A pseudo-linear reduction of damage that encourages the opponent
          to use higher-damage attacks over lower-damage ones.
    ATK - A multiplier for the damage of damaging abilities.
    SP - The unit's universal ammo count.
    LP - The number of times a unit can fall before being destroyed.
    DYNAMIC - A quality of the unit that will affect how they're played
              outside of the normal rules of battle.
    Status Effects - Additional rules applied to the character on a per-
                     battle or per-turn basis.
    Primary Class - The abilities pool that the unit has unrestricted
                    access to and which has the biggest impact on their role
                    in battle.
    Secondary Class - An abilities pool from which the unit can access all
                      but the most powerful abilities. Adds utility to the
                      character outside of a rigid role.
    Tertiary Class - A very limited abilities pool from which the unit can
                     only access the most trivial abilities. Maybe useful in
                     the clutch. Provided by the unit's equipment.
    Equipment - Affects the unit's growth and tertiary class. May also
                provide an additional Dynamic. Permanently bound to unit.

We can't really get a vision of how any unit will behave in battle until we start thinking about the 'classes,' which are just the ability pools. That being said, do we need any other attributes for individual characters.

I feel like the numerical attributes (HP, ATK, SP, LP) are pretty simple. Overly simple? I think that the real interesting differences between units will come from their 3 classes and their dynamics. HP affects 'tankiness'. ATK is an attribute that will affect your likeliness to want to attack with them. That sounds obvious, but it's kind of interesting because characters like healers, status-afflicters, buff'ers, don't really need ATK. They're not really going to ever attack the enemy directly. They would need SP instead of ATK.

When you see a unit that has high SP, you should expect them to be able to use more expensive abilities, which could have a big function in combat outside of doing direct HP damage -- or they could do exceptional HP damage. A unit with high SP is a unit to be especially wary of, and it might be a good idea to target them with abilities that reduce their MP to limit what they're capable of.

If a character has high LP, they're more reliable in combat. You don't need to dance around keeping them on their feet as desperately. On the other hand, characters with low LP might be very powerful but they're very fragile.

I was thinking last night that rather than having units have an elemental attack attribute and an elemental weakness attribute, maybe every unit should just have a single elemental 'type'. Some units would take more damage FROM these types. Others would deal more damage TO these types. Some might take LESS damage from these types, or MORE damage from these types -- but it wouldn't be about 'type' matchup. It'd be due to a Dynamic or a status effect.

In other words, it wouldn't be that 'Fire' units are always strong against 'Ice' units. It's more like, THIS PARTICULAR UNIT deals more damage to Fire units. The unit's 'types' don't directly interact at all. It's just a quality of Dynamics and status effects. The only reason that each unit would have a 'type' would be so that these Dynamics could effect them differently.

I don't think that I personally want to fuck around with accuracy. I don't know for sure if I've ever played a game -- and I've played a lot of JRPGs -- where I've really enjoyed having an evasion mechanic. Typically, units will have some kind of 'dodgeability' attribute and some kind of 'accuracy' attribute, and, when dealing a direct attack, these attributes will be compared between the attacker and the defender and that will calculate the percentage chance of the attack completely missing.

I just can't imagine a situation where that sort of dice-roll could have a strictly positive impact on the depth fo strategy. On the one hand, it adds risk and it incentivizes the player to minimize risk in intesive situations by relying on higher-accuracy units / abilities, and it also adds an element of dynamism where you plan has to change based on whether or not a previous ability connected. But I also feel like it can make certain units over-powered (if they have high evasion attribute) and, in a game where every turn is going to matter so much, and units can die semi-permanently, it seems like it could make low-accuracy abilities or units much, much less feasible in combat. I feel like the risk might be too high. I wonder if it woiuld make more sense to just have every ability be assumed to connect, unless the unit is under the effect of some Status Ailment (which can be stacked) which would reduce their likelihood of hitting.

From what I understand, there are guys out there that will look at a move in a JRPG that says, "20% chance to hit for triple damage," and that's attractive to them. Every JRPG I've played has abilities like this. I've never used them. I can't stand them. I don't see the point to them. Because you're gonna win the encounter if you stay solid and play smart. Why take such a big risk just to end it a little bit sooner?

Some people like gambling. I don't like gambling. I like certainty -- but gambling adds a thrill, it adds risk. To some people, that's exciting. I find it annoying.

I still feel like having 'accuracy' be a core part of the game (a stat of every unit, along with 'evasion') isn't something I want to do. I'm not opposed (and may be in favor of) having accuracy or evasion-affecting status effects, and I can also concede that it may add tactical interest to the game for select abilities to come packaged with a chance to miss.

HereGoes brings up the point that, sometimes, chance-to-miss attacks in JRPGs make for great hail-marys. What I find interesting about that statement is that he mentions that these attacks may be 'insta-kills'. It makes me think that, because of what I said about the importance of 'staying solid' and having a 'RELIABLE stategy,' moves that have a high chance to miss really should have KILLER benefits if they succeed. I feel like maybe a part of the reason that I've never really been attracted to these 'high chance to miss' moves in JRPGs is that the trade-off just isn't worth the risk. You might get a 'crit', which is bullshit. I can't risk my entire strategy just to get a crit.

On the other hand, if the reward was sufficiently high, maybe I could see how you COULD put your entire strategy into jeopardy and risk having to recover after a failure. Let's keep that in mind as we design classes and abilities; it might be cool to have some abilities that have a high chance to miss but are very, very rewarding if they succeed. That's an incentive to 'gamble' that I can understand.

We're continuing to look at what numerical attributes our units need to make combat more interesting.

Here's what I was thinking while talking to Kenny last about how battle would play out: in a game that's going in the direction that ours is, units are so much more than their numerical attributes. In fact, the more I think about it, the more they're like cards in a collectible card game. Here's why I say that:

The way that you play a unit and play AGAINST a unit is based heavily on their Dynamic and their classes. So, when you're facing an opponent, you basically want to read their 'description', and that affects how you play against them -- sort of like the text on a card. Every unit has its own rule (Dynamic) which you basically need to know when going up against them. Kinda reminds of a collectible card game.

DEF usually is a multipler that reduces HP damage. But, again, how is that really different from having more HP? Any time that a unit gets more DEF, couldn't you have just given them more HP and still have the same effect?

Panders mentions that 'defense' could affect low-damage attacks and high-damage differently. Perhaps your attack has to exceed some amount of damage before it can 'crack' the enemy's defense.

Is that kind of overpowered? On the discussion of having to 'crack' the enemy's defense, Panders puts forward an equation where defense reduces the amount of damage done in a linear fashion, which rewards higher-damage attacks over lower-damage attacks. This could positively impact the strategies that your opponent comes up with, because if they have a few remaining AP to consume on their turn, using a low-damage attack becomes less attractive. They want to deal damage in big, lump hits. This isn't a concern you would have against an opponent that has low defense.

Let's talk for a second about 'growth' and what I believe are the trappings of it. This being true of any JRPG, but especially of monster-collection JRPGs.

I've been thinking about the benefits and the disadvantages of having a traditional 'level-up' system, where each unit gains EXP at the end of battle and then, after acruing so much, they 'level up' and their attributes increase.

To me, the major disadvantage of going this route -- well, there's two:
    1.) It rewards the player directly for sticking with the same team. In
        a game where you've got potentially more than a hundred types of
        units to choose from, and where you want to reward the player for
        trying different strategies and re-configuring their team based on
        the challenges they expect to face in the near future, I think that
        you want to avoid situations where the player is saying to them-
        selves, "I could try this other unit, but they're under-leveled, and
        so I would need to grind in order to bring them into my party."

    2.) It rewards the player for grinding and overpowering their opponent
        with numerical superiority. We want for our players to succeed based
        on how well they can apply a strategy and build a team that has good
        synergy. If you reward the player for grinding, you're basically
        rewarding them for sacrificing their TIME rather than having to
        develop a strong strategy.

That's to say that I'm entirely against character growth. But I think that maybe we should come up with a way that allows for the leader and their units to get stronger (and have more complex strategies available to them, or open up new areas to them where the opponents were previously too powerful) in such a way that they all level-up UNIFORMLY. There's an EXP 'pool' that all units share under one leader, or something, so that you can bring any unit onto your team for the first time and they're up to speed.

The player should be rewarded for completing battles with some kind of character growth. I love the idea that, after an encounter, the player is given new possibilites for managing their team -- that's what character growth is all about, to me. Character growth gives you some creative power over your team; you've earned some currency, and now you can spend that currency to give you more tactical options. Make you feel more confident in dealing with future scenarios.

On the other hand, the downside of this very same property is that it can trivialize future encounters if you do it too much (grinding). And like we said, it can disadvantage new additions to the team, which discourages the player from swapping out units -- and that's the last thing I want to do. I want to encourage the player to swap out units as much we can.

So, at some point, we're going to need to think of a way to 'grow' characters or teams in such a way that new units can be 'brought up to speed' very quickly.

*) GoodVibe mentions the GENERAL GAME DESIGN CONCEPT of exhaustion, and that's something that I like, too, because it adds more depth and dynamism to the strategy. It means that your first encounter on an adventure will have different rules, effectively, than your tenth encounter. I like the idea that you have to pace yourself or risk burning out, and I like that, as you get burned out, encounters that might've been easy at first are now major threats. In our design so far, we've looked at that 'exhaustion' as something that occurs over the course of a single battle.

In fact, I've considered that, since we want for each fight to be at such a high difficulty, it would probably make sense to have the units' HP, etc., be restored completely between fights. That way, we can balance each encounter so that the player is encouraged to totally blow their load. Sacrifice HP, sacrifice SP -- and, ideally, they would NEED to do that in order to win. I feel like that could greatly enhance the stress-levels (in a good way) per fight, versus most JRPGs where because you have to fight SO many monsters as you explore, each individual encounter can't be TOO intensive. What ends up happening is that the game becomes pretty easy.

If we can balance our combat so that it's super-intense, I feel like that implies having to make major sacrifices in each fight, which means that it would probably make sense to refresh the team after each encounter.

GoodVibe's got me thinking: maybe the leader / team could have a simple 'exhaustion' attribute which goes up after encounter and debuffs the team slightly over time, even if their numerical attributes do get refreshed.

*) Zanzhu brings up the idea that, aside from rewarding units for appearing in combat by giving them EXP (and, by extension, level-ups), EXP can also be put into a 'pool' that can be selected expended to any unit that the leader might have access to.

One risk of this, right away, is that the player might be inclined to spend that EXP on the units that were just in the battle. One way to avoid this would be to have level-ups require exponentially more EXP. That way, spending it on a high-level unit would yield much less reward than spending it on a low-level unit. Lower-level units grow a LOT more per-EXP than high-level ones.

I feel like we made a lot of progress with our design, tonight. Next time (Monday) I would like to start talking about classes. What sorts of abstract 'roles' might our units need to fill on our team? What sorts of abilities would make sense within those roles?

Very importantly, how many units do we want on a single team? We want for each team to have strengths and weaknesses, tactically. We want for the player to have to sacrifice some options in order to open up other options. If each unit has access to 3 classes, how many units do we need for the player to have enough options to deal with a variety of enemy teams without giving them SO many options that they can deal with ANY enemy team.

We want the player to ALWAYS WISH they had access to ONE more class or ONE more unit. We want them to make difficult decisions about who is included in their team. How many units do we need to have on each time to succeed in that? It's a dance to control how often the player needs to switch units, and how flexible we want for individual teams to be so that they don't run the risk of entering a fight where they basically have NO chance of winning because they came in with the wrong team. Each time needs to be SOMEWHAT flexible but also restricted enough that the player has to make regular and difficult decisions about who to include on their team.

Before I forget, this is an idea that I've been playing with and we can discuss more in the future; I just want to write it down before I forget:

What if. Instead of having a traditional JRPG "team" that can only be changed at a save-point. Every encounter started with a draft. (This was inspired by last night's 3S Team Battle).

What if one of the two teams in battle (player or opponent) could get 'initiative,' and that meant that the opponent had to pick a unit from their collection and show it to the player. Then, the player could pick a unit from THEIR collection to counter that unit.

And then the opponent would pick ANOTHER unit to counter THAT unit. That way, I feel like you could encourage the player to familiarize themselves with a wide variety of strategies and units, and change their team on a per-battle basis with some foresight into what strategies the opponent has available to them. Before battle, you would be able to see what your opponent's team and they would be able to see what YOUR team is. I kinda think that's a cool idea, and it adds an element of strategy and gameplay before the battle even starts.

There would be UI difficulties, and you'd need to be able to sort your collection of units so that your favorites are on top, or something, depending on how many units you have. It could end up being a lot of scrolling. But I think it's a cool way to encourage the player to not get too attached to a single team and encourage them to pick the right tools for the job before each job.

*) Cajun mentions that individual units could have an 'exhaustion' attribute which would also encourage the player to try different units. Worth thinking about.

Panders brings up the idea, half-jokingly, that teams could be constructed at random. I was talking with Kenny, last night, about how forcing the player to re-evaluate their plan and come up with something on the fly is a virtue of game design, I feel like. Maybe there's some kind of status ailment or something that causes the opponent's team (or the player's team) to have one character slot filled by a random unit from their collection.

What if, before battle, the player could only pick from a pool of units from their collection that is, itself, randomized. You'd basically draw 20 cards from a deck, and be able to bring 4 of those cards into your hand.

When considering the way that units (monsters) will level-up, perhaps they gradually unlock their second and tertiary classes, or they unlock their dynamics, or they maybe even unlock secondary equipment slots -- or something like that. Maybe the level-ups aren't strictly about raising stats or learning new "abilities" from their classes.

I think that the average amount of AP that a leader should get per turn is 10 AP. That's what they start their turn with.

This way:
    *) The weakest abilities in the game can cost 1 AP.
    *) Character tagging (which is super significant to tactics) can cost
       3 AP.
    *) This way, you can basically tag twice per turn, but, by doing so,
       you limit the amount of actions you can do to consuming 4AP, which
       could be one kind of powerful ability or a couple middling abilities.
    *) This would prevent the player from being able to swap a tank OUT, use
       some abilities, and then swap the tank back IN before the end of the
       turn. With 10 AP to work in this set-up, that would be doable and
       even very tactical for some teams, but it would limit the amount of
       offense your team would have.

Even if only a little bit, I like gnomedjunior's idea that the leader could gain AP as they level up. Because of the way the game is engineered, it couldn't be by MUCH, but I do like the idea of opening up more tactical possibilities to the player as the game goes on.

For 'offensive' classes, they have a ratio of 3:1 attack to 'utility' skills. 'Standard' classes can be about even, and 'utility' classes can be mostly utility skills with a few offensive skills.

What Panders is saying is that, if you group attack abilities into a range of damage-to-cost, you can give 'attack centric' classes a bigger variety of tactical options when it comes to dealing damage at a variety of costs. On the other hand, classes which are more 'limited' in terms of attack potential may be able to do a LOT of damage per turn, but they won't have as many OPTIONS for damage-to-cost. So, some non-attack classes may ONLY have low-cost, low-damage attack abilities. Other non-attack classes may have only a couple HIGH cost HIGH damage abilities -- but, in any case, only the 'offense' classes will have the widest variety of cost and damage breadth. That way, the 'offensive' classes can effectively do damage in a wider variety of scenarios.

gnomedjunior is joining us for the first time, today, and doesn't really have a great grasp of how our combat is going to play out, but I do like his ideas for broad roles in combat, including "scout," "utility", "tank", "stealth".

gnomedjunior brings up the idea of some powerful attacks maybe even draining the MP of multiple units.

gnomedjunior brings up the idea for a 'dynamic' where maybe a certain unit (or even a unit under a certain status effect) will gain power based on how much damage they take.

Let me talk about 'status changes' for a moment:

In traditional JRPGs, status changes are relatively straight-forward, and by that I mean:
    *) They'll either last for a certain number of turns (maybe with some
       randomness).
    *) Or they'll be removed directly by either 'curing' a negative status
       change or 'dispeling' a positive one.
    *) Maybe certain items or abilities can cure PARTICULAR status changes,
       or you'll have an item or ability that cures ALL status changes.

That's how it works in a typical JRPG.

I was thinking, what if status changes have special requirements to cure them, rather than just 'casting the ability that cures it' or 'using the item that cures it' or 'waiting some number of turns'.

What if some status changes will only wear off after a the character takes a certain amount of damage, or inflicts a certain amount of damage, or consumes a certain amount of MP, or AP. What if a status change only wears off after the unit has been tagged in or out a certain number of times. I think that could be more interesting and have a greater impact on your tactics.

And maybe instead of having every 'curative' ability directly remove the status change, what if some just 'lessen the condition.' Maybe you're poisoned, and you're gonna stay poisoned until you tag out three times. Maybe a healer could have an ability that would lower that 'curative requirement' down to only needing to be swapped once.

I think we don't really need status changes that persist outside of combat. We've already got the 'exhaustion' system for adding some stress to the player between encounters.

My idea was not that certain status ailments like 'poison' would always require the same condition to cure it, but rather that certain abilities might inflict poison DIFFERENTLY. Certain abilities might inflict a poison that wears off after a certain number of turns, while others might inflict the same 'ailment' but with a different condition for curing it. Maybe some abilities might inflict a status ailment with a somewhat randomized condition for curing that ailment.

On the subject of ailments, Panders mentions an idea where the afflicted unit could only use even or odd AP costing abilities.

GnomedJunior brings up the awesome idea of a ailment or ability that would neutralize a unit or leader's 'dynamic'.

LasteveqA_ brings up an idea that I'd considered but hadn't remembered to write down until now: what if some status ailments were like 'threats'. That is to say, they don't trigger right away but have a condition that must be met for them to take affect.

GnomedJunior brings up the idea of abilities that only trigger when the unit that used them is attacked (counter abilities). These would make sense for 'tanky' classes.

GnomedJunior also mentions the idea of 'traps'. We touched on this with LasteveqA_'s idea of 'threat' status changes, but what if we had certain abilities that would add new 'dynamics' or 'rules' to the entire battlefield. We haven't considered that before.

Up to this point, we've given dynamics (special rules) to units and leaders, and we have status changes that can apply special rules, but what if there was a slot for a dynamic that applied to the entire battle rather than just individual units or leaders. What if you could use a skill that would cause any unit that attacks with MP to take damage. I guess maybe we don't need that, since you could also look at it as just adding that dynamic to both teams.

It would be more clear if, rather than giving both leaders the same 'status change,' there was a slot for rules that affects the entire battlefield. Let's lock that in.

Status changes can be inflicted on UNITS and will affect that unit individually.
Status changes can be inflicted on the LEADER, which will affect the entire team.
Status changes can be inflicted on the BATTLEFIELD, which will affect both teams equally.

Maybe certain dungeons or areas or parts of the game carry special rules on the battlefield.

gnomedjunior brings up the idea that having various rules apply to the battlefield might encourage different strategies or empower certain classes. We're always looking for ways to encourage the player to switch up their team and exploit different strategies.

It'd be cool if certain rules on the battlefield could trigger other rules. LasteveqA_ mentions that rules could 'level up,' and I'm choosing to interpret that as, maybe, after a certain amount of time, a rule becomes more severe -- or, when triggered, the rule might become more severe.
